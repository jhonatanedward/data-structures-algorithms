# Longest Prefix Suffix

Longest prefix suffix is the value of the longest prefix which is also a suffix of a string.

## prefix

Proper prefix is a substring that occurs at the beginning of a string and a proper prefix is all prefixes
that are not equal to the string itself.

ex:

String: "hello"

proper prefixes : "h", "he", "hel", "hell".

## Suffix

A suffix of a string is a substring that occurs at the end of the string and a proper suffix is 
all suffixes that are not equal to the string.

String "hello"

proper suffix : "o", "lo", "llo", "ello"


## Understanding LPS Array.

LPS is a preprocessing algorithm, that will be used by another algorithm, like KMP.
So given a pattern like "aacaaaac" LPS array size will be 8, since the pattern contains 8 caracteres. 
And that array will store at each index, the value of the Longest Prefix that is also a suffix inside that substring,
for example.

| Index | Substring so far  | LPS\[i] | Reason (in plain English)                                                       |
| ----- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | a                 | 0       | No proper prefix and suffix.                                                    |
| 1     | a a               | 1       | The prefix `"a"` is also a suffix.                                              |
| 2     | a a b             | 0       | No prefix equals the suffix in this part.                                       |
| 3     | a a b a           | 1       | `"a"` is both prefix and suffix.                                                |
| 4     | a a b a a         | 2       | `"a a"` appears at both start and end.                                          |
| 5     | a a b a a a       | 3       | `"a a a"` is suffix and also at the start.                                      |
| 6     | a a b a a a a     | 4       | `"a a a a"` is both prefix and suffix.                                          |
| 7     | a a b a a a a b   | 3       | Now the end is `"a a b"` which is the same as the prefix starting from index 0. |
| 8     | a a b a a a a b a | 4       | \`"                                                                             |


## Algorithm

- The variable **i** Will be used to walkthrough all char at the string.
- The variable **len** will be used to compute de length of Longest Prefix which is also suffic in the current substring.

### `s[i] = s[len]` ‚Üí
We can extend, we increment `len` (which is also the length), we put it in `lps[i]`, and we increment `i` to move to the next cell in the array.

---

### `s[i] ‚â† s[len]` and `len > 0` ‚Üí
We take `len` to the length of the LPS of the part that matched, which is the part that ends at `len - 1`.  
We can find the length of its LPS in `lps[len - 1]`, this is why we take `len` to `lps[len - 1]`.

---

### `s[i] ‚â† s[len]` and `len = 0` ‚Üí
We put `0` in `lps[i]` and increment `i` to move to the next cell in the array.

üß† Tips to understand better:

Always compare pattern[i] with pattern[len].

On match, increase len and assign it to lps[i].

On mismatch, reduce len = lps[len - 1], and try again (without moving i).

This way we avoid repeating comparisons, making it efficient (O(n) time).
